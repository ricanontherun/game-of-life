A cell will need to know about all 8 of it's neighbors (or at least the states of them).
Storing just the cell states might help reduce memory usage by avoiding object references and just storing integers.

The grid can be represented by a N x M multidimensional array. Given a coordinate pair, we should be able to calculate the precise coordinate
pair of all of the neighbors of a particular cell.

Boundaries can be interpreted as a "toroidal" array, where the top/bottom and left/right borders are essentially stiched into a single plane.
